## Description of the Project 
This was a really fun assignment. The assignment takeaways were showing us out to style a page programmatically. The result is a set of eyes that move across the screen that follow the movement of the users' mouse. I again chose to get a bit creative by giving the eyes a complete face.
___
## How to Run
Once you copy all the files, you just open the index.html file and the site will automatically start responding according to the movement of the users mouse activity.

##### Support
If you are having issues, please let me know, and <a href="mailto:pamela.afaneh@gmail.com"> email me.</a>
___
## Roadmap of future improvements
- I would like to add funny sounds to the page.  
- I would also like to create the layout so that he had friends behind him that its responses are the opposite in movement, so it looks like his friends are having different reactions.
